Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill 
sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. (I am using python, if everything goes according to plan I will try to do some exercises in C++)

All exercises can be found on https://adventofcode.com/.
